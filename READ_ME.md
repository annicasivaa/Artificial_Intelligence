# Assignment 1

Here, I have implemented code that explores routes through cities. The different algorithms conveys shortest routes in different time.

# Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to get a better understanding of supervised learning with gradient descent. It will, in particular, consider the similarities and differences between linear classifiers and multi-layer feed forward networks (multi-layer perceptron, MLP) and the differences and similarities between binary and multi-class classification. A main part will be dedicated to implementing and understanding the backpropagation algorithm. 

- Classify dataset
- Labeling
